This visualization represents a selection of the anthologies in the collection as colored glyphs.  Each glyph begins as a nine-sided figure, its radius determined by the number of stories included in the anthology. When a glyph is clicked on, it changes its shape to reflect the thematic content of the stories within the anthology.  The content was classified using Everett Bleilerâ€™s hierarchy of nine major science fiction motifs, each branch containing more specific motifs also used to describe the stories.  Bleiler keywords were assigned to each story as themes and motifs were touched upon within the stories. These anthology glyphs' positions are determined by a statistical technique called Multidimensional Scaling. Each anthology is given a set of 'scores' based on its properties.  The Multidimensional Scaling determines coordinates for each glyph in relation to its similarity to the other glyphs. The closer a glyph is to another, the more similar they are based on their scores. We developed five different ways to calculations of an anthology score, and thus have five different mappings available for the glyphs to discover similarities and differences between the glyphs depending on the calculations.
